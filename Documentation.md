## HTML

There are two HTML pages. `index.html` and `3dmap.html`.

### 3dmap.html
This page is the Unity build of the 3D-truck.
This is standalone in every way from the rest of the website and should be rebuilt and integrated to the rest of the website using a javascript library such as Three.js.

### index.html
This page is the home for the rest of the website. It contains skeleton code and code for some of the static elements.
The rest of the HTML is created dynamically in javascript.
